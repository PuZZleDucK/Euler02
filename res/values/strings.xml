    <string name="main_app_text">Thanks for trying Euler 02. This is my programmatic solution to challenge 2 of Project Euler.\n\nThe problem description is as follows:\n By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.\n\n My solution allows a user to select even or odd and sum the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence from 1 to the selected count. This values are displayed with uncounted Fibonacci numbers in red and the total sum at the bottom right.\n\n It is interesting to note the odd-odd-even sequence of the Fibonacci numbers explaned by the cyclic adding of pairs of odd-odd to produce even, then even-odd to produce an odd, then odd-even to produce andother odd and then odd-odd to start the cycle again.\n\nIcon image is derrived from the work of Leslie Chatfield c/o Fotopedia&#8230; link above.\n\nI hope you enjoy, I\'m looking forward to creating more.</string>
    <string name="main_dev_text">Thanks for trying Euler 02.\n\nPlease support further developent by following the links below to rate and review my apps in the Play Store (or in your own Blog :D) or you can support development directly by contribuiting code or commentary to the project on GitHub directly.\n\nThis project is 100% open source and gpl.\n\nIn any case thanks for supporting PuZZleDucK Industries by installing Euler 01 [Hello Euler] in the first place.\n\nYou can also help support development by helping me up my Dropbox capacity by using me as a reference ;) it\'s quick, painless and best of all FREE :D what are you waiting for!</string>
